      <h1>Starting the creation of the Workout Tracker</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Zac Binger. I am creating a workout creation and tracking
        web application using HTML, CSS, and Flask (Python).
      </p>
      <p>
        Through extreme flexibility and ease of use, you will be able to
        create and track highly customizable workouts and keep track of
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>One day this app will help you look like this:</p>
